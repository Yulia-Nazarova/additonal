Whiplash in the dead of night
And down on Sunset dynamite
Blinding lights on the Marquee shining brigh

There's George on his knees again
On the town with Miss Zimmerman
Alert the media and then my friend

Ooh la la in L.A., Ooh la la in the U.S.A
One night stands with a one night band is this

You see the food and you feel the force
B.L.T. and there ain't no sauce
